// üîç What is useState in React?
// useState is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components.
// Before hooks, state was only available in class components. But now, with 
// hooks like useState, you can manage state directly in function components.


// what are hooks??

// React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to access React state 
// and lifecycle features, previously exclusive to class components. Introduced in React 
// 16.8, they offer a more concise way to manage state and side effects.
